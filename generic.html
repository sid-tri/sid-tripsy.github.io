									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>My name is Siddharth Tripathi.<br />
									A Data science professional having 3 years of experience in Retail and Web Domain. <br/>Experience in executing complete life cycle of Data science Projects.<br/> Implemented Deep learning, NLP, recommender systems, BI & data <br/>and feature engineering solutions at production scale.
									<br />
									I am currently looking for jobs in Data Science and Business Intelligence.</p>

								<!--<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>-->
				
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pictest.jpg" alt="" /></span>I pursued my undergraduate program in Electronics and Communication Engineering at R.V
									College of Engineering, Bengaluru from August 2012 to May 2016. Opportunities flooded
									with every coming year, and I got a chance to work on a project which combined IoT with
									Machine Learning algorithms and was titled as ‘Sewerage Monitoring with Predictive
									Maintenance using Machine Learning’. Having submitted the research to the International
									Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET) for review, we got it published in
									the IRJET Journal in May 2019. During fourth year, I worked on another project titled ‘Cloud
									Based Intelligent Traffic System’, which, after rounds of review, was published in 3rd
									International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICOEI), sponsored by
									IEEE.
									During the four years of undergrad studies, I learned software programming skills by taking
									electives like OOPS with C++ and Data Structures. These skills helped me during the campus
									placement and I was able to secure a job at one of the largest American Bank namely “Wells
									Fargo”. I joined Wells Fargo as an Analyst and worked under the Consumer Lending
									Technology department as a part of the Home Equity Business Intelligence Team. My team
									was responsible for driving ‘Technology Health Refresh (THR)’ activity which involved
									upgrading platform architecture for the online banking application, wherein I contributed by
									developing, optimizing and maintaining data architectures.<br/><br/> In Sep 2017, I joined Rankethon, an
									education-tech services company, as a Senior Associate. I was responsible for planning,
									forecasting and developing deep business insight for the third-party syndication and
									distribution network of the educational institutions throughout the country. I designed,
									developed and established KPIs to monitor analysis and provide strategic insights to drive
									performance in all delivery measures including Marketing and Customer Service metrics
									using Tableau and SAS. I got an opportunity to expand my knowledge to implement Machine Learning & Deep Learning algorithms using Python and R in solving complex analytics problems.
									My enthusiasm, coupled with the scope for innovations and opportunities available in the
									field of Data Analytics, has kept me motivated to contribute to the industry.
